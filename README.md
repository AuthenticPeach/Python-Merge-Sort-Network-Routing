# Network Routing Optimization Program

This is a Python program that demonstrates how Merge Sort can be used to optimize network routing based on specific criteria. In this simplified example, we sort a list of network routes by their length, from shortest to longest.

Program Description
The program defines a list of network routes, where each route is represented as a dictionary with a name ("route") and a length ("length") in kilometers.

The Merge Sort algorithm is used to sort the network routes based on their length in ascending order (shortest to longest).

The sorted routes are then printed to the console, showing the route name and its length.

Sample output
Sorted Network Routes:
Route: Route D, Length: 75 kilometers
Route: Route B, Length: 90 kilometers
Route: Route A, Length: 120 kilometers
Route: Route C, Length: 150 kilometers
